# online-exam-management-system



This project encompasses a database designed to store records of students, their subjects, and the online exams they undertake. It's built using MySQL software and Python programming language. The primary database, named python_project, comprises five entities: exam, marks, Instructor, Student, and subject, each representing different aspects of the educational system.

Within the login module, we've integrated the Twilio library for the OTP functionality. Users need to create a Twilio account to obtain a free trial API, which must be substituted in the code. The system accommodates three types of users: Admin, Teacher, and Student. Each user is granted access to specific features based on their role within the system.
